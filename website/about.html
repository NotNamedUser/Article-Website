            This is a website created by me and a friend during summer holidays. I mainly did it to *try* (I don't like front end dev) and learn html, css and js. My friend wanted to explore more about his interests in environmental sciences and the associated disciplines (He is actually trying to fake an independent "journalist" (something like that idk) to get free science journals (Omg!!!!)
